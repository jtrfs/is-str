# My first 'pseudo' npm package

1. following **Kyle** from Web Dev Simplified: [link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4b_T-qH3BY&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)
2. creating this **README** file
3. creating **.gitignore** file via shell function I've installed
4. `git init` ... I want to start form my computer, Kyle first created a remote repo ... I'd like to use gh.
5. `git add` and `git commit`
6. using **gh** cli tool to create remote repo:
   `gh repo create is-str --public -s=. --push -d "I have tried to create my first npm package after testing it locally"`
7. gradually I'll hopefully make it work ... we will see :wink:
8. other steps ...
