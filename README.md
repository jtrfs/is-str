# My first 'pseudo' npm package

1. following **Kyle** from Web Dev Simplified: [link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4b_T-qH3BY&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)
2. creating this **README** file
3. creating **.gitignore** file via shell function I've installed
4. using **gh** cli tool to create remote repo
   gh repo create is-str --public -s=. -d "I have tried to create my first npm package after testing it locally"
5. gradually I'll hopefully make it work ... we will see :wink:
6. other steps ...
